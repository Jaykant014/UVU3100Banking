# “UVU3100 Safe Banking System”
The concept of “UVU3100 Safe Banking System” is a secure mobile banking application designed to protect user data, ensure safe authentication, and provide an easy-to-use experience. This project focuses on preventing key security risks, such as insufficient data validation and insufficient network, which are common in mobile banking.
The goal is to create a safe and efficient platform for financial transactions using strong encryption techniques and following industry security standards. Built for Android, the app will incorporate modern security frameworks to keep user transactions protected from potential cyber threats.
